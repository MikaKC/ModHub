# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Contribution

# 💭 FAQ:
Q: When will an x64 version release?<br>
A: Probably never, the fork of cocos that I use would need heavy reworking for it to be compatible with 64 bit architectures.<br><br>
Q: How can I ask for new features?<br>
A: On the official Mod Hub [discord server](https://www.mikakc.ml/redirect/modhub), you can ask in the #features channel for a new suggestion, simply create a new entry by writing the name of the feature as well as a brief description of your desired feature in the message.
